AthleteIQ2.0 is a website that aims to help students and athletes improve themselves. It is an updated version of my previous project called AthleteIQ. The website features a progress bar on the dashboard to track daily performance. The progress bar is based on completion of various checklists that are designed to help users improve physically and academically. The goal is to achieve as close to 100% completion rate as possible each day. Some of the tasks that need to be completed daily include logging exercises, sleep and water intake, and completing homework assignments. The website also allows users to log their exercises and track their progress visually to help plan future workouts.
